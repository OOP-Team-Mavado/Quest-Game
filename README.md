### The gameplay ###
> Step 1: There are several classes from which the player chooses one at the begining of the game

> Step 2: At random are assigned Quests and Bombs. the quests give the player points and the bombs takes points from the player. Bomb damage (1-3). Each movement takes 0.1 point from the player so the player needs to be mindful for the most optimal path they need to take.

> Step 3: after the player has completed enough quests - they can proceed to the win area or complete more quests.
